## Architecture

- Single-file SwiftUI app (`CTTracker6App.swift`)
- Uses iOS 17's `.onChange(of:initial:)` for reactive updates
- Secure keychain storage for API credentials
- Async/await networking with URLSession
- **GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification)** static schedule parsing
  - Downloads and parses Caltrain GTFS feed from Trillium Transit
  - Shows complete train schedule for any selected time (not just real-time trains)
  - Custom pure-Swift ZIP extractor using Apple's Compression framework (iOS compatible)
  - Parses CSV files: stops.txt, trips.txt, stop_times.txt, calendar.txt, calendar_dates.txt
  - Service calendar logic determines which trips run on which days (handles weekdays and exception dates)
  - Handles GTFS time format (supports times like "25:30:00" for next day)
  - Includes after-midnight trains (up to 5 AM) in evening schedules
  - Automatically fetches tomorrow's early morning service when viewing late-night departures
  - Calculates actual minutes until departure from current time
  - 24-hour cache with automatic refresh
- **SIRI API integration** for real-time enhancements
  - Extracts train numbers from VehicleRef field for accurate identification
  - Overlays real-time service types (Local, Limited, etc.) on scheduled trains
  - Provides service alerts and delay information
  - Smart merge strategy: prefers real-time data over scheduled data for accuracy
  - Calculates arrival times from GTFS when OnwardCalls unavailable
- **Arrival Time Calculation**
  - Matches departure time to GTFS trip (within 2 minutes)
  - Finds arrival time at destination stop from schedule
  - Displays full journey time (e.g., "8:16 PM ‚Üí 8:45 PM")
  - Fallback when SIRI OnwardCalls not supported by API
- **Delay Prediction Engine**
  - Machine learning-based delay predictions using historical data
  - Stores delay records locally in UserDefaults (JSON encoded)
  - Each record contains: train number, stop code, scheduled time, actual delay, day of week, hour
  - Pattern matching algorithm filters by train number, stop code, day of week, and hour (¬±1 hour tolerance)
  - Confidence levels based on sample size: High (‚â•10), Medium (‚â•5), Low (<5)
  - Automatic cleanup: keeps only most recent 500 records (20,000 in DEBUG mode)
  - Privacy-first: all data stored locally on device, never uploaded
  - Automatically learns from real-time data by recording delays when GTFS and SIRI data diverge
  - Displays predicted delays in dedicated Alerts tab with push notifications
- **Security Features**
  - Thread-safe Keychain access with concurrent DispatchQueue (sync writes to prevent race conditions)
  - API rate limiting (5 seconds between requests to same endpoint)
  - Smart rate limit handling: 15s initial delay + 5s between calls to avoid 429 errors
  - Network retry logic with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
  - Sanitized error messages (no server response leaks)
  - ZIP path traversal and ZIP bomb protection
  - Input validation for API keys and file paths
- Robust SIRI XML/JSON response parsing
- Haversine formula for calculating distances between venues and stations
- Custom splash screen with fade-out animation
- Event capacity filtering (optional 20,000+ venues filter)
