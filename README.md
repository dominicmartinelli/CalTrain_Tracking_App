## Setup

### Required API Keys

1. **511.org API Key** (Required for train tracking)
   - Get free key: [511.org/open-data/token](https://511.org/open-data/token)
   - Used for real-time Caltrain data and service alerts

2. **Ticketmaster API Key** (Optional for events)
   - Get free key: [developer.ticketmaster.com](https://developer.ticketmaster.com)
   - Used for Bay Area events discovery

### First Launch

1. Build and run the app in Xcode
2. On first launch, enter your 511.org API key
3. Go to **Stations** tab to select your two stations:
   - **Southern Station**: Your station closer to San Jose (e.g., Mountain View)
   - **Northern Station**: Your station closer to SF (e.g., 22nd Street)
4. (Optional) Go to **Settings** tab to add Ticketmaster API key for events
5. The app will show:
   - **Trains**: Northbound (southern ‚Üí northern) and Southbound (northern ‚Üí southern)
   - **Events**: Today's events in the Bay Area
   - **Alerts**: Service disruptions with visual status
   - **Stations**: Configure your commute stations
   - **Settings**: Manage API keys and view about info

## Architecture

- Single-file SwiftUI app (`CTTracker6App.swift`)
- Uses iOS 17's `.onChange(of:initial:)` for reactive updates
- Secure keychain storage for API credentials
- Async/await networking with URLSession
- **GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification)** static schedule parsing
  - Downloads and parses Caltrain GTFS feed from Trillium Transit
  - Shows complete train schedule for any selected time (not just real-time trains)
  - Custom pure-Swift ZIP extractor using Apple's Compression framework (iOS compatible)
  - Parses CSV files: stops.txt, trips.txt, stop_times.txt, calendar.txt, calendar_dates.txt
  - Service calendar logic determines which trips run on which days (handles weekdays and exception dates)
  - Handles GTFS time format (supports times like "25:30:00" for next day)
  - Calculates actual minutes until departure from current time
  - 24-hour cache with automatic refresh
- **SIRI API integration** for real-time enhancements
  - Overlays real-time service types (Local, Limited, etc.) on scheduled trains
  - Provides service alerts and delay information
  - Merges SIRI real-time data with GTFS scheduled data for best of both worlds
- Robust SIRI XML/JSON response parsing
- Haversine formula for calculating distances between venues and stations
- Custom splash screen with fade-out animation
- Event capacity filtering (20,000+ venues only)
